A program that reads text and outputs it in multiple column format. The input consists of a first line containing a single number C, the number of columns in the subsequent lines. The second and later lines contain C integers per line separated by whitespace. All numbers will be greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1000. The program outputs the data organized into a columns as follows: 

  + Each number occupies the space of 3 digits, right justified, and with no leading zeros 
  + Columns are separated by the string: “ | ” (space, pipe symbol, space) 
  + The first and the last line contain exactly 6C-3 dash characters (“-“), i.e. the same number of characters as each of the remaining lines 
  + There is no other extraneous whitespace or trailing separators
